        <p>Hello everyone! I am super excited to be starting this web development class with you all. Let me start with a little about myself.</br>
        I am 22 years old and I currently live with my fiancee who is also in school along side me just taking different classes. We live in the <a>Rocklin, California</a></br> 
        area and have a kitty named Alice.</p> 
         
        
        <p>I like to spend my time onewheeling with a group of people from the area every day. We sometimes ride up to 150 miles a week </br>
        on these things offroad! My other enjoyable hobby is driving with my fiancee. Her and I both have cars we love to drive together every day, and it makes </br>
        generic store trips just a bit more fun :)</p>

        <p>My absolute move favorite thing in the world is programming and virtual design. I currently work as a full time IT Specialist and a part time cryptocurrency startup </br>
        partner with a local DAO. My main jobs can range from completely rebuilding a computer from scratch, networking a windows server, to updating websites creating scripts </br>
        for job efficiency, and even pioneering the first ever audited "non-custodial web3 recurring payment protocol" which I am very proud of and excited for it to take off. </p>
