      <p>
        Home page about VESC boards. Our open source technology allows for creative minds from all 
        over the world to collaborate on and engineer the smoothest, safest, and gnarliest one wheeled 
        hyper core personal electronic vehicle. Our version of a VESC, otherwise known as "Vedder 
        Electronic Speed Controller" can optimize the current shell of a stock "Onewheel" device.
        Alternatively DIYers can buy or make their own parts required to hold our pre built VESC 
        components. We offer all the little tips, tricks, and resources to correctly build your 
        board with no mistakes. Throughout the year we try to offer live group sessions to allow
        an expert to assist you as quickly as possible. Be sure to check out all the links with 
        available parts to fully customize your one of a kind VESC board.

      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>
        Learn how to DIY your own VESC pev. Here we offer all the resources to convert your current stock 
        "onewheel" from Future Motion or to get all the parts to create your own model of a VESC using 
        our components on third party hardware. This project is not a beginner DIY project, and requires a 
        large amount of attention to details as well as the correct tools to complete the job. Do not begin this project if you 
        do not believe you can complete it alone, or if you are not confident dissasembling the shell of a 
        onewheeled device. Just as there are many pros to converting your board into a VESC, or even building 
        one from scratch, there are many cons as well. Some of the pros include right to repair, extra torque, off road maneuverability, 
        runs cooler, customizable, consistent updates and work being done from the community contributors, 
        etc... While some of the cons include difficulty to assemble, very advanced settings that are not easy 
        for beginners, unfimiliarity with controls, and major risk of injury due to lack of safety features. We have
        prepared information about and places to buy motor controllers, hub motors, tires, Bluetooth 
        modules, motherboard protector, air pumps and other parts & tools for your own DIY VESC board. 
        By the end of your build, you will fully understand how a VESC works and what it is capable of.

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        Get virtual assistance with your DIY project fast. We offer live assistance via live streaming sessions on specified dates throughout the year.
        Our incredible contributors and volunteers have offered to book live sessions for groups to learn the
        process of designing, building, and repairing their very own custom VESC personal electronic vehicle.
        Dont miss out on valuable information given at these build sessions that may help you avoid simple 
        mistakes while building your VESC. We try to fit everyone in our build sessions by planning a minimum
        of 12 build sessions a year, one at the beginning of each month. You may send us an email about scheduling 
        and purchasing a ticket to secure your spot at the next expert build session. Build session tickets are a flat 
        rate of $100 and allow for any questions to be asked during the event, as well as assistance with any 
        future maintance information by email for the life of the product. Click the link below to check out 
        all of the social forums, websites, and clubs related to building your own VESC pev machine. Stay stoked :)
